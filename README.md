# DSL White Paper

**Diesel Token (DSL)** is a symbolic and functional alternative to the exploitative attention economy.  
It fuels direct, ethical exchange between Creators, Communities, and Platforms — where value flows through trust, not tricks.

This repository hosts the living white paper for DSL:  
a spark in the dark, meant to ignite a fire of creator-first engagement.

## 🔥 What Is DSL?

- **De-Sell**: A refusal to sell out, to sell attention, to sell trust  
- **Fuel**: Micro-payments as energy transfers between aligned participants  
- **Governance**: Modular, opt-in, symbolic voting and adaptive incentives  
- **Platform**: Built on Algorand for speed, sovereignty, and principled scalability
